    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "While at IBM, Arthur Samuel developed a program that learned how to play checkers (1959). He called it:\n",
    "\n",
    "“The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "As programmers, we often approach problems in a methodical, logic-based way. We try to determine what our desired outputs should be, and then create the proper rules that will transform our inputs into those outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning flips the script. We want the program itself to learn the rules that describe our data the best, by finding patterns in what we know and applying those patterns to what we don’t know.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms are able to learn. Their performance gets better and better with each iteration, as it uncovers more hidden trends in the data."

    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be branched out into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fraudulent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we explicitly tell a program what we expect the output to be, and let it learn the rules that produce expected outputs from given inputs, we are performing supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine you’re first learning about different genres in music. Your music teacher plays you an indie rock song and says “This is an indie rock song”. Then, they play you a K-pop song and tell you “This is a K-pop song”. Then, they play you a techno track and say “This is techno”. You go through many examples of these genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time you’re listening to the radio, and you hear techno, you may think “This is similar to the 5 techno tracks I heard in class today. This must be techno!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the teacher didn’t tell you about this techno track, she gave you enough examples of songs that were techno, so you could recognize more examples of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we explicitly tell a program what we expect the output to be, and let it learn the rules that produce expected outputs from given inputs, we are performing supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of this is image classification. Often, we want to build systems that will be able to describe a picture. To do this, we normally show a program thousands of examples of pictures, with labels that describe them. During this process, the program adjusts its internal parameters. Then, when we show it a new example of a photo with an unknown description, it should be able to produce a reasonable description of the photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous-valued output. Examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. What is the housing price in Neo York?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. What is the value of cryptocurrencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problems, we are trying to predict a discrete number of values. Examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Is this a picture of a human or a picture of an AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Is this email spam?"

    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are an alien who has been observing the meals people eat. You’ve embedded yourself into the body of an employee at a typical tech startup, and you see people eating breakfasts, lunches, and snacks. Over the course of a couple weeks, you surmise that for breakfast people mostly eat foods like:\n",

    "Cereals\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagels\n",
    "\n",
    "Granola bars\n",

    "Some sort of vegetable\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sort of protein\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sort of grain\n",
    "\n",
    "Snacks are usually a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts. No one explicitly told you what kinds of foods go with each meal, but you learned from natural observation and put the patterns together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, we don’t tell the program anything about what we expect the output to be. The program itself analyzes the data it encounters and tries to pick out patterns and group the data in meaningful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this includes clustering to create segments in a business’s user population. In this case, an unsupervised learning algorithm would probably create groups (or clusters) based on parameters that a human may not even consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Unsupervised Learning*** is a type of machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Clustering*** is a common unsupervised machine learning approach that finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",

    "Social networks clustering topics in their news feed\n",
