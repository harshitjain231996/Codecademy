    "## Manhattan Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan Distance is extremely similar to Euclidean distance. Rather than summing the squared difference between each dimension, we instead sum the absolute value of the difference between each dimension. It’s called Manhattan distance because it’s similar to how you might navigate when walking city blocks. If you’ve ever wondered “how many blocks will it take me to get from point A to point B”, you’ve computed the Manhattan distance.\n",

    "## Hamming Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamming Distance is another slightly different variation on the distance formula. Instead of finding the difference of each dimension, Hamming distance only cares about whether the dimensions are exactly equal. When finding the Hamming distance between two points, add one for every dimension that has different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamming distance is used in spell checking algorithms. For example, the Hamming distance between the word “there” and the typo “thete” is one. Each letter is a dimension, and each dimension has the same value except for one.\n"

    "Euclidean Distance .euclidean()\n",
    "Manhattan Distance .cityblock()\n",
    "Hamming Distance .hamming()\n",
    "There are a few noteworthy details to talk about:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the scipy implementation of Manhattan distance is called cityblock(). Remember, computing Manhattan distance is like asking how many blocks away you are from a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the scipy implementation of Hamming distance will always return a number between 0 an 1. Rather than summing the number of differences in dimensions, this implementation sums those differences and then divides by the total number of dimensions. For example, in simple implementation, the Hamming distance between [1, 2, 3] and [7, 2, -10] would be 2. In scipy‘s version, it would be 2/3."
