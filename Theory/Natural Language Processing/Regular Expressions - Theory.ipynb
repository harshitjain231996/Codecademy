    "\\s: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range [ \\t\\r\\n\\f\\v], matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab\n",
    "For example, the regex \\d\\s\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. Thus the regex completely matches the text 3 monkeys.\n",

    "The answer is yes, with the help of quantifiers! Fixed quantifiers, denoted with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.\n",

    "\\w{3} will match exactly 3 word characters\n",
    "\\w{4,7} will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters\n",

    "\n",
    "An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be greedy. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex mo{2,4} will match the text moooo in the string moooo, and not return a match of moo, or mooo. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of os as possible, which is 4 in the string moooo."

Optional quantifiers to the rescue!\n",

Note the ? only applies to the character directly before it.\n",
