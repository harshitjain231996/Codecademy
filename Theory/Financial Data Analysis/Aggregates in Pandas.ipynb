    "## Calculating Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a bunch of data, we often want to calculate aggregate statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, percentiles, etc.) over certain subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we use the following syntax to calculate aggregates:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby('column1').column2.measurement()\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "column1 is the column that we want to group by ('student' in our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "column2 is the column that we want to perform a measurement on (grade in our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "measurement is the measurement function we want to apply (mean in our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "![p](https://i.imgur.com/5aVE8c1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "After using groupby, we often need to clean our resulting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous exercise, the groupby function creates a new Series, not a DataFrame. For our ShoeFly.com example, the indices of the Series were different values of shoe_type, and the name property was price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we’d prefer that those indices were actually a column. In order to get that, we can use reset_index(). This will transform our Series into a DataFrame and move the indices into their own column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, you’ll always see a groupby statement followed by reset_index:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby('column1').column2.measurement()\n",
    "    .reset_index()\n",
    "    \n",
    "When we use groupby, we often want to rename the column we get as a result.\n",
