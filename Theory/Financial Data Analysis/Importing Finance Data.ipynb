    "\n",
    "In some cases you’ll pass the API key directly into the pandas-datareader function you’re using to access the API.\n",

    "\n",
    "When an API is intermittently offline or not working we call it flaky.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can’t control if an API acts flaky, but here’s a few tips to help ensure it doesn’t prevent us from building something great.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test your code - Testing as often as possible will ensure your code works from day to day and will help to identify any APIs that are consistently acting flaky.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep up to date with the datareader documentation - Because we’re accessing these finance APIs through pandas-datareader, that’s a good place to look if an API starts acting unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Actively monitoring the pandas-datareader project on GitHub - Sometimes there are bugs in the pandas-datareader project, instead of the APIs it’s calling. The github page for the project is a good place to ask questions and stay up to date on the latest issues identified in the project."

    "\n",
    "Two useful calculations that can be made on financial data are variance and covariance.\n",

    "### Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average. In finance, this is used to determine the volatility of investments.\n",

    "In the variance calculations above, stocks have a larger value than bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s because the stock prices are more spread out than bonds, indicating that stocks are a more volatile investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance, in a financial context, describes the relationship between the returns on two different investments over a period of time, and can be used to help balance a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling cov() on our stocks/bonds produces a matrix which defines the covariance values between each column pair in the DataFrame.\n",
