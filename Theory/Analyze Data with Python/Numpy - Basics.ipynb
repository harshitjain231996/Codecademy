    "## NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy includes a powerful data structure known as an array. A NumPy array is a special type of list. It’s a data structure that organizes multiple items. Each item can be of any type (strings, numbers, or even other arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are most powerful when they are used to store numbers. This is because arrays give us special ways of performing mathematical operations that are both simpler to write and more efficient computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array looks a lot like a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])'\n",
    "\n",
    "We can transform a regular list into a NumPy array by using np.array() and saving the value to a new variable:\n",

    "## Selecting Elements from a 1-D Array\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows us to select elements from an array using their indices. In typical Python fashion, the indices for an array start at 0. This is known as zero-indexed numbering. In the array above, 5 is known as the zeroth element, a[0]. It follows that 2 is the first element, a[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also select negative indices, which count from opposite end of the array and start at -1. This is particularly useful when you want to access the last element or two of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to select multiple elements in the array, we can define a range, such as a[1:3], which will select all the elements from a[1] to a[3], including a[1] but excluding a[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we wanted to select all elements before a[3] we would use: a[:3]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use negative indices to select multiple elements. Let’s say we want to select the last 3 elements in an array: \n",

    "Selecting elements from a 2-d array is very similar to selecting them from a 1-d array, we just have two indices to select from. The syntax for selecting from a 2-d array is a[row,column] where a is the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that when we work with arrays that have more than one dimension, the relationship between the interior arrays is defined in terms of axes. A two-dimensional array has two axes: axis 0 represents the values that share the same indexical position (are in the same column), and axis 1 represents the values that share an array (are in the same row).\n",

We can easily write some code that checks to see whether this statement evaluates to True for each item in the array, without having to use a for loop :\n",

    "## Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrays are a special type of list that allows us to store values in an organized manner.\n",
    "2. An array can be created by either defining it directly using np.array() or by importing a CSV using np.genfromtxt('file.csv', delimiter=',').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An operation (such as addition) can be performed on every element in an array by simply performing it on the array itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Elements can be selected from arrays using their index and array locations, both of which start at 0.\n",
    "5. Logical operations can be used to create new, more focused arrays out of larger arrays.\n",
