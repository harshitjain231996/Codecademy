    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a data visualization, your goal is to communicate the insights found in the data. While visualizing communicates important information, styling will influence how your audience understands what you’re trying to convey.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have formatted and visualized your data, the third and last step of data visualization is styling. Styling is the process of customizing the overall look of your visualization, or figure. Making intentional decisions about the details of the visualization will increase their impact and set your work apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing the Overall Look of Your Figure\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn enables you to change the presentation of your figures by changing the style of elements like the background color, grids, and spines. When deciding how to style your figures, you should take into consideration your audience and the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Themes\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn has five built-in themes to style its plots: darkgrid, whitegrid, dark, white, and ticks. Seaborn defaults to using the darkgrid theme for its plots, but you can change this styling to better suit your presentation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use any of the preset themes pass the name of it to sns.set_style(). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"darkgrid\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Color\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about the look of your visualization, one thing to consider is the background color of your plot. The higher the contrast between the color palette of your plot and your figure background, the more legible your data visualization will be. Fun fact: dark blue on white is actually more legible than black on white!\n",
    "\n",
    "The dark background themes provide a nice change from the Matplotlib styling norms, but doesn’t have as much contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"dark\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "The white and tick themes will allow the colors of your dataset to show more visibly and provides higher contrast so your plots are more legible:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"ticks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grids\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being able to define the background color of your figure, you can also choose whether or not to include a grid. Remember that the default theme includes a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a good choice to use a grid when you want your audience to be able to draw their own conclusions about data. A grid allows the audience to read your chart and get specific information about certain values. Research papers and reports are a good example of when you would want to include a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also instances where it would make more sense to not use a grid. If you’re delivering a presentation, simplifying your charts in order to draw attention to the important visual details may mean taking out the grid. If you’re interested in making more specific design choices, then leaving out the grids might be part of that aesthetic decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"white\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Despine\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to changing the color background, you can also define the usage of spines. Spines are the borders of the figure that contain the visualization. By default, an image has four spines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to remove some or all of the spines for various reasons. A figure with the left and bottom spines resembles traditional graphs. You can automatically take away the top and right spines using the sns.despine()function. Note: this function must be called after you have called your plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"white\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.despine()\n",
    "\n",
    "Not including any spines at all may be an aesthetic decision. You can also specify how many spines you want to include by calling despine() and passing in the spines you want to get rid of, such as: left, bottom, top, right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling Figure Styles for Different Mediums\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib allows you to generate powerful plots, but styling those plots for different presentation purposes is difficult. Seaborn makes it easy to produce the same plots in a variety of different visual formats so you can customize the presentation of your data for the appropriate context, whether it be a research paper or a conference poster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the visual format, or context, using sns.set_context()\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the usage of sns.set_context(), there are three levels of complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass in one parameter that adjusts the scale of the plot\n",
    "2. Pass in two parameters - one for the scale and the other for the font size\n",
    "3. Pass in three parameters - including the previous two, as well as the rc with the style parameter that you want to override.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn has four presets which set the size of the plot and allow you to customize your figure depending on how it will be presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order of relative size they are: paper, notebook, talk, and poster. The notebook style is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "a. sns.set_style(\"ticks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment-> # Smallest Context\n",
    "    \n",
    "   sns.set_context(\"paper\") \n",
    "\n",
    "   sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "    \n",
    "b. sns.set_style(\"ticks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   #Largest Context:\n",
    "         \n",
    "sns.set_context(\"poster\") \n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Fonts and Line Widths\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also able to change the size of the text using the font_scale parameter for sns.set_context()\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to also change the line width so it matches. We do this with the rc parameter, which we’ll explain in detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment -># Set font scale and reduce grid line width to match\n",
    "    \n",
    "sns.set_context(\"poster\", font_scale = .5, rc={\"grid.linewidth\": 0.6})\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "While you’re able to change these parameters, you should keep in mind that it’s not always useful to make certain changes. Notice in this example that we’ve changed the line width, but because of it’s relative size to the plot, it distracts from the actual plotted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment -># Set font scale and increase grid line width to match\n",
    "sns.set_context(\"poster\", font_scale = 1, rc={\"grid.linewidth\": 5})\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The RC Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned above, if you want to override any of these standards, you can use sns.set_context and pass in the parameter rc to target and reset the value of an individual parameter in a dictionary. rc stands for the phrase ‘run command’ - essentially, configurations which will execute when you run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_style(\"ticks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_context(\"poster\")\n",

    "## Commands for Working with Palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build color palettes using the function sns.color_palette(). This function can take any of the Seaborn built-in palettes. You can also build your own palettes by passing in a list of colors in any valid Matplotlib format, including RGB tuples, hex color codes, or HTML color names.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to quickly see what a palette looks like, use the function sns.palplot() to plot a palette as an array of colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -> # Save a palette to a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "palette = sns.color_palette(\"bright\")\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -> # Use palplot and pass in the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.palplot(palette)\n",
    "\n",
    "To select and set a palette in Seaborn, use the command sns.set_palette() and pass in the name of the palette that you would like to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -> # Set the palette using the name of a palette:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_palette(\"Paired\")\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -> # Plot a chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seaborn Default Color Palette\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not pass in a color palette to sns.color_palette() or sns.set_palette(), Seaborn will use a default set of colors. These defaults improve upon the Matplotlib default color palettes and are one significant reason why people choose to use Seaborn for their data visualizations. Here’s a comparison of the two default palettes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn also allows you to style Matplotlib plots. So even if you’re using a plot that only exists in Matplotlib, such as a histogram, you can do so using Seaborn defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, call the sns.set() function before your plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment-> # Call the sns.set() function \n",
    "sns.set()\n",
    "for col in 'xy':\n",
    "  plt.hist(data[col], normed=True, alpha=0.5)\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does this function allow you the ability to use Seaborn default colors, but also any of Seaborn’s other styling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn has six variations of its default color palette: deep, muted, pastel, bright, dark, and colorblind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use one of these palettes, pass the name into sns.set_palette():\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -># Set the palette to the \"pastel\" default palette:\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.set_palette(\"pastel\")\n",
    "\n",
    "comment -># plot using the \"pastel\" palette\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.stripplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Color Brewer Palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the default palette and its variations, Seaborn also allows the use of Color Brewer palettes. Color Brewer is the name of a set of color palettes inspired by the research of cartographer Cindy Brewer. The color palettes are specifically chosen to be easy to interpret when used to represent ordered categories. They are also colorblind accessible, as each color differs from its neighbors in lightness or tint.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use, pass the name of any Color Brewer palette directly to any of the color functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "custom_palette = sns.color_palette(\"Paired\", 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.palplot(custom_palette)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting Color Palettes for Your Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative Palettes for Categorical Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a dataset that uses distinct but non-ordered categories, it’s good to use qualitative palettes. Qualitative palettes are sets of distinct colors which make it easy to distinguish the categories when plotted but don’t imply any particular ordering or meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the name implies, sequential palettes are a set of colors that move sequentially from a lighter to a darker color. Sequential color palettes are appropriate when a variable exists as ordered categories, such as grade in school, or as continuous values that can be put into groups, such as yearly income. Because the darkest colors will attract the most visual attention, sequential palettes are most useful when only high values need to be emphasized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diverging Palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "Diverging palettes are best suited for datasets where both the low and high values might be of equal interest, such as hot and cold temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "diverging_colors = sns.color_palette(\"RdBu\", 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.palplot(diverging_colors)"
