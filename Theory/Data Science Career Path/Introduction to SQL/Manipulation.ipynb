    "## Introduction to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. Here, the relational database contains one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. Here the table is celebs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A column is a set of data values of a particular type. A row is a single record in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "\n",
    "    column_1 data_type, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    column_2 data_type, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    column_3 data_type\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the components of a statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.\n",
    "2. table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.\n",
    "3. (column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used does not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read."
