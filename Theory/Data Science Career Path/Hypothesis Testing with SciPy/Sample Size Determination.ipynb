    "One of the first steps to designing a successful experiment is determining the number of samples that you need in order to have confidence in the results. We don’t want to go through the trouble of running an A/B test or administering a survey only to discover that we don’t have enough information to make a good decision.\n",

    "## A/B Test\n",
    "\n",
    "An A/B Test is a scientific method of choosing between two options (Option A and Option B). Some examples of A/B tests would include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What number of sale items on a website makes customers most likely to purchase something: 25 or 50?\n",
    "2. What color button are customers more likely to click on: blue or green?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B tests compare an option that we’re currently using to a new option that we suspect might be better. In order to compare the two options, we need a metric. Generally, our metric will be the percent of users who take a certain action after interacting with one of our options. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The percent of customers who buy a t-shirt after visiting one of two versions of a website\n",
    "2. The percent of users who click on one of two versions of an ad\n",
    "3. The percent of readers who open an email with one of two subject lines\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the sample size for our A/B test, we need to know whether we expect our metric to be low or high. It will take more samples to be able to spot a difference when our metric is extremely low or extremely high. Our initial estimate of our metric is called a baseline.\n",

    "### Determining Lift\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re running an A/B Test in order to know if Option B is better than Option A but if Option B were only a tiny percent better, would we really care? In order to detect precise differences, we need a very large sample size. In order to choose a sample size, we need to know the smallest difference that we actually care to measure. This “smallest difference” is called lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift is generally expressed as a percent of the baseline conversion rate. Suppose that 6% of our customers currently buy socks on our website Sock Hops (that’s our baseline conversion rate). We think that a new website layout would increase this. Changing a website layout is hard, so we only think that it’s worth doing if at least 8% of our customers would buy socks on Sock Hops with the new layout. That means that we want to increase our conversions by 2%. To calculate lift:\n",

    "\n",
    "Viral Villanelle’s social media presence drives visits to its website. Product Manager Brian wants to test a new ad. Using a sample size calculator, he finds that he will need a sample size of 1,100. Viral Villanelle’s current advertisement is shown to 500 users per day. What’s the best way for Brian to get his desired sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember that Brian will need to show both the old and the new ad to 1,100 users each. If Brian wants to complete this test as quickly as possible, he could randomly divide users into two groups: half of users would see the old ad and half would see the new ad. It would take a little more than 4 days for 2,200 users to see one of the two ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if Brian doesn’t want to divide Viral Villanelle’s audience evenly? If Brian is running many different types of A/B tests, he might not want to expose users to a barrage of different tests. Maybe only 10% of users should be shown the new ad, in case it performs terribly. By doing this, he would only be getting 50 users per day towards the 1,100 users that need to see the new ad. In this case, he would need to wait for 22 days (1100 / 50 = 22) in order to get his results, even though he would have gotten the 1,100 views for the old ad 3 days into the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For his final analysis, Brian should use all of the data from the 22 days. The Chi-Square test will correctly take into account that there is more data from the original ad than from the new ad.\n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean to have “enough” people for a survey? Generally, we are making sure that our results are within a margin of error of the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is the furthest we expect the true value to be from what we measure in our survey. For example, let’s say we choose a margin of error of 4%. If we get results showing 40% of people love beets the most, we can be confident that the true proportion in the population lies somewhere between 36% and 44%. Thus, the smaller we make the margin of error, the more certainty we have in the results. The larger we make the margin of error, more uncertain we are that they represent the views of the total population.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our sample should accurately represent the population as a whole. So, when we are dealing with a larger population, we should probably be sampling more people.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes tricky to determine what the effective population size is. For example, suppose there are 200 people who currently visit BeetsMe regularly. Is 200 the population size for our vegetable survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BeetsMe wants to appeal to the tourists that frequently visit Vancucumber, or if they ever want to launch an online store to ship healthy treats all over the world, the real population size is closer to 8 billion (or infinity, really, if we think about the number of humans who could eventually exist and have vegetable preferences). So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. Normally, 100,000 will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, for decisions that require extrapolation to an unknown customer base, it is important to understand the preferences of a typical person out in the world, whether or not they are part of your customer base right now. Generally, we use this larger population size of 100,000 or greater instead of focusing on the amount of current customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the small town of Vancucumber is holding an election for a new mayor, and we want to project the results of the election, then the 1700 citizens would be the only important people. In this case, 1700 is the population size we would use in a sample size calculator.\n",

    "### Likely Sample Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, before we conduct a survey, we have a guess of what we expect the results to be. This guess could be based upon the results from a previous survey, or perhaps the results of a small pilot study before the real study.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the expected proportion of people with the desired trait decreases, we can survey fewer people. For example, if we are projecting election results and Candidate C has 1% of the voter base, taking a small sample of only 5 people might be fine, because it is very likely that no one we have chosen is voting for Candidate C. This is close enough to the true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the expected proportion increases, it is rarer that we hit that proportion accurately with the random sample we choose.\n",

As we increase the confidence level, we must have a larger sample size.\n",
