    "\n",
    "Some situations involve correlating numerical data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "a professor expects an exam average to be roughly 75%, and wants to know if the actual scores line up with this expectation. Was the test actually too easy or too hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "a manager of a chain of stores wants to know if certain locations have different revenues on different days of the week. Are the revenue differences a result of natural fluctuations or a significant difference between the stores’ sales patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "A PM for a website wants to compare the time spent on different versions of a homepage. Does one version make users stay on the page significantly longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Others involve categorical data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "a pollster wants to know if men and women have significantly different yogurt flavor preferences. Does a result where men more often answer “chocolate” as their favorite reflect a significant difference in the population?\n",
    "\n",
    "do different age groups have significantly different emotional reactions to different ads?\n",

    "In this lesson, you will learn how about how we can use hypothesis testing to answer these questions.

    "## 1 Sample T-Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine the fictional business BuyPie, which sends ingredients for pies to your household, so that you can make them from scratch. Suppose that a product manager wants the average age of visitors to BuyPie.com to be 30. In the past hour, the website had 100 visitors and the average age was 31. Are the visitors too old? Or is this just the result of chance and a small sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test this using a univariate T-test. A univariate T-test compares a sample mean to a hypothetical population mean. It answers the question “What is the probability that the sample came from a distribution with the desired mean?”\n",
    "\n",
    "When we conduct a hypothesis test, we want to first create a null hypothesis, which is a prediction that there is no significant difference. The null hypothesis that this test examines can be phrased as such: “The set of samples belongs to a population with the target mean”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the 1 Sample T Test is a p-value, which will tell us whether or not we can reject this null hypothesis. Generally, if we receive a p-value of less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and state that there is a significant difference.\n",

    "\n",

    "For a p-value of 0.05, if the null hypothesis is true then the probability of obtaining a significant result is 1 – 0.05 = 0.95. When we run another t-test, the probability of still getting a correct result is 0.95 * 0.95, or 0.9025. That means our probability of making an error is now close to 10%! This error probability only gets bigger with the more t-tests we do.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last exercise, we saw that the probability of making a Type I error got dangerously high as we performed more t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing more than two numerical datasets, the best way to preserve a Type I error probability of 0.05 is to use ANOVA. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests the null hypothesis that all of the datasets have the same mean. If we reject the null hypothesis with ANOVA, we’re saying that at least one of the sets has a different mean; however, it does not tell us which datasets are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the SciPy function f_oneway to perform ANOVA on multiple datasets. It takes in each dataset as a different input and returns the t-statistic and the p-value. For example, if we were comparing scores on a videogame between math majors, writing majors, and psychology majors, we could run an ANOVA test with this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "fstat, pval = f_oneway(scores_mathematicians, scores_writers, scores_psychologists)\n",

    "The null hypothesis, in this case, is that all three populations have the same mean score on this videogame. If we reject this null hypothesis (if we get a p-value less than 0.05), we can say that we are reasonably confident that a pair of datasets is significantly different. After using only ANOVA, we can’t make any conclusions on which two populations have a significant difference.\n",

    "## Assumptions of Numerical Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "Before we use numerical hypothesis tests, we need to be sure that the following things are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The samples should each be normally distributed…ish\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysts in the real world often still perform hypothesis on sets that aren’t exactly normally distributed. What is more important is to recognize if there is some reason to believe that a normal distribution is especially unlikely. If your dataset is definitively not normal, the numerical hypothesis tests won’t work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we have three datasets, each representing a day of traffic data in three different cities. Each dataset is independent, as traffic in one city should not impact traffic in another city. However, it is unlikely that each dataset is normally distributed. In fact, each dataset probably has two distinct peaks, one at the morning rush hour and one during the evening rush hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, using a numerical hypothesis test would be inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The population standard deviations of the groups should be equal\n",
    "\n",
    "For ANOVA and 2-Sample T-Tests, using datasets with standard deviations that are significantly different from each other will often obscure the differences in group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for similarity between the standard deviations, it is normally sufficient to divide the two standard deviations and see if the ratio is “close enough” to 1. “Close enough” may differ in different contexts but generally staying within 10% should suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The samples must be independent\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two or more datasets, the values in one distribution should not affect the values in another distribution. In other words, knowing more about one distribution should not give you any information about any other distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples where it would seem the samples are not independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the number of goals scored per soccer player before, during, and after undergoing a rigorous training regimen\n",
    "2. a group of patients’ blood pressure levels before, during, and after the administration of a drug\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand your datasets before you begin conducting hypothesis tests on it so that you know you are choosing the right test.\n",

    "## Tukey's Range Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say that we have performed ANOVA to compare three sets of data from the three VeryAnts stores. We received the result that there is some significant difference between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have to find out which datasets are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform a Tukey’s Range Test to determine the difference between datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we feed in three datasets, such as the sales at the VeryAnts store locations A, B, and C, Tukey’s Test can tell us which pairs of locations are distinguishable from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function to perform Tukey’s Range Test is pairwise_tukeyhsd, which is found in statsmodel, not scipy. We have to provide the function with one list of all of the data and a list of labels that tell the function which elements of the list are from which set. We also provide the significance level we want, which is usually 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were looking to compare mean scores of movies that are dramas, comedies, or documentaries, we would make a call to pairwise_tukeyhsd like this:\n",

    "## Binomial Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine that we are analyzing the percentage of customers who make a purchase after visiting a website. We have a set of 1000 customers from this month, 58 of whom made a purchase. Over the past year, the number of visitors per every 1000 who make a purchase hovers consistently at around 72. Thus, our marketing department has set our target number of purchases per 1000 visits to be 72. We would like to know if this month’s number, 58, is a significant difference from that target or a result of natural fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we begin comparing this, if there’s no mean or standard deviation that we can use? The data is divided into two discrete categories, “made a purchase” and “did not make a purchase”.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been working with numerical datasets. The tests we have looked at, the 1- and 2-Sample T-Tests, ANOVA, and Tukey’s Range test, will not work if we can’t find the means of our distributions and compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a dataset where the entries are not numbers, but categories instead, we have to use different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze a dataset like this, with two different possibilities for entries, we can use a Binomial Test. A Binomial Test compares a categorical dataset to some expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comparing the actual percent of emails that were opened to the quarterly goals\n",
    "2. Comparing the actual percentage of respondents who gave a certain survey response to the expected survey response\n",
    "3. Comparing the actual number of heads from 1000 coin flips of a weighted coin to the expected number of heads\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis, in this case, would be that there is no difference between the observed behavior and the expected behavior. If we get a p-value of less than 0.05, we can reject that hypothesis and determine that there is a difference between the observation and expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy has a function called binom_test, which performs a Binomial Test for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "binom_test requires three inputs, the number of observed successes, the number of total trials, and an expected probability of success. For example, with 1000 coin flips of a fair coin, we would expect a “success rate” (the rate of getting heads), to be 0.5, and the number of trials to be 1000. Let’s imagine we get 525 heads. Is the coin weighted? This function call would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "pval = binom_test(525, n=1000, p=0.5)\n",

If we get a p-value less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that it is likely the coin is actually weighted, and that the probability of getting heads is statistically different than 0.5.\n",

    "In the last exercise, we looked at data where customers visited a website and either made a purchase or did not make a purchase. What if we also wanted to track if visitors added any items to their shopping cart? With three discrete categories of data per dataset, we can no longer use a Binomial Test. If we have two or more categorical datasets that we want to compare, we should use a Chi Square test. It is useful in situations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An A/B test where half of users were shown a green submit button and the other half were shown a purple submit button. Was one group more likely to click the submit button?\n",
