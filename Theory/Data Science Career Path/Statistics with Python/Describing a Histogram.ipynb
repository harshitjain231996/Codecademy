    "## Center\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common ways to summarize a dataset is to communicate its center. We will use average and median as our measures of centrality. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve found the center of your data, you can shift to identifying the extremes of your dataset: the minimum and maximum values. These values, taken with the mean and median, begin to indicate the shape of the underlying dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skew\n",
    "Once you have the center and range of your data, you can begin to describe its shape. The skew of a dataset is a description of the data’s symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset with one prominent peak, and similar tails to the left and right is called symmetric. The median and mean of a symmetric dataset are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "![symmetric](https://i.imgur.com/B7AZEbm.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram with a tail that extends to the right is called a right-skewed dataset. The median of this dataset is less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "![right skew](https://i.imgur.com/iOGUbRD.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram with one prominent peak to the right, and a tail that extends to the left is called a left-skewed dataset. The median of this dataset is greater than the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Modality\n",
    "The modality describes the number of peaks in a dataset. Thus far, we have only looked at datasets with one distinct peak, known as unimodal. This is the most common.\n",
